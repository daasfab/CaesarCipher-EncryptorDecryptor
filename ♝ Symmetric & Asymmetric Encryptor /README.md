# Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption 

## ❔ What is it

One of the better encryption types that exists today. Depending on your needs, one will have clear strengths and the other will have distinct weaknesses. Thus, I decided to make an encryptor and a decryptor for both Symmetric & Asymmetric encryption types!

## 👨🏻‍💻 Dev Process

For both the private and public keys, I will need to make a completely random key generator. That will be challenging, as computers are not random and purely generate things by using pre-determined mathematical formulas. 
I will be using this guide to make the key generator: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/security/generating-keys-for-encryption-and-decryption
