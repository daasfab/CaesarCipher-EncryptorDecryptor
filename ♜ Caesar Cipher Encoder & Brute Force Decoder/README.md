# Caesar Cipher

## ❔ What is it

Caesar CVipher is one of the oldest forms of data encryption, which shifts every character in a string to another by a certain num of spaces away from it (which is set by the encryptor and is the key of the cipher). Clearly, it is far from secure as anyone can calculate the key by brute-forcing the encrypted string with little effort (as there are only 26 letters in the English alphabet, hence only 26 possible keys).

That is why I chose it as a starting/entrance point into the world of cybersecurity!
