# Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption 

## ❔ What is it

A better encryption type than the basic Caesar Cipher. Depending on your needs, one will have clear strengths and the other will have distinct weaknesses. Thus, I decided to make an encryptor and a decryptor for both Symmetric & Asymmetric encryption types!

### Symmetric Encryption:

</div>

I'm using python to program both types of encryption. 

First, install the cryptography library:  
<mark>pip install cryptography</mark>

Then, import Fernet and colored libraries:  
<mark>from cryptography.fernet import Fernet</mark>  
<mark>from termcolor import colored</mark>

Lastly, code in the key generator for the Symmetric Encryptor.

Here is the result:

</div>

### Asymmetric Encryption:
