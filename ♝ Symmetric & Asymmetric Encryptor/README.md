# Symmetric & Asymmetric Encryption 

## ❔ What is it

One of the better encryption types that exists today. Depending on your needs, one will have clear strengths and the other will have distinct weaknesses. Thus, I decided to make an encryptor and a decryptor for both Symmetric & Asymmetric encryption types!

## 👨🏻‍💻 Dev Process

### Symmetric Encryption:

I'm using python to programm both types of encryption. 

First, install the cryptography library:
<span style="background-color: yellow;"> pip install cryptography </span>


Then, import Fernet and colored libraries:
<span style="background-color: yellow;"> from cryptography.fernet import Fernet </span>
<span style="background-color: yellow;"> from termcolor import colored </span>


Lastly, code in the key generator for the Symmetrict Encryptor.

Here is the result:
